[#release-notes-2-25-0]
== 2.25.0

Release date:: 2025-06-13

This minor release introduces bug fixes, behavior improvements, and complete support for GraalVM native image generation.

[#release-notes-2-25-0-graalvm]
=== GraalVM Reachability Metadata

Log4j Core and all extension modules now include embedded
https://www.graalvm.org/latest/reference-manual/native-image/metadata/[GraalVM reachability metadata],
enabling seamless generation of native images with GraalVM out of the box—no manual configuration required.
For more information, refer to our xref:graalvm.adoc[GraalVM guide].

[NOTE]
====
When building third-party Log4j plugins, using the new `GraalVmProcessor`
introduced in version `2.25.0` will automatically generate the required reachability metadata for GraalVM native images.
However, the processor will fail the build if the required `log4j.graalvm.groupId` and `log4j.graalvm.artifactId` parameters are not provided.
For detailed instructions, see xref:manual/plugins.adoc#plugin-registry[Registering plugins].

[#release-notes-2-25-0-PL-ex]
=== Exception Handling in Pattern Layout

Exception handling in xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc[Pattern Layout] has undergone a significant rewrite.
This update resolves several bugs and ensures consistent behavior across all exception converters.
Key improvements include:

* Stack traces are now consistently prefixed with a newline instead of other whitespace.
* The default exception converter has changed from xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converter-exception-extended[extended] to xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converter-exception[plain], offering better performance.
* Support for the `\{ansi}` option in exception converters has been removed.

[#release-notes-2-25-0-instant-format]
=== Date & Time Formatting

Log4j has historically provided custom date and time formatters for performance, such as
link:javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/util/datetime/FixedDateFormat.html[`FixedDateFormat`] and
link:javadoc/log4j-core/org/apache/logging/log4j/core/util/datetime/FastDateFormat.html[`FastDateFormat`].
These are now deprecated in favor of Java’s standard
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/{java-target-version}/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html[`DateTimeFormatter`].

If you encounter formatting issues after upgrading—particularly with `n` or `x` directives—you can temporarily revert to the legacy formatters by setting the xref:manual/systemproperties.adoc#log4j2.instantFormatter[`log4j2.instantFormatter`] property to `legacy`.
Please report any issues via our {logging-services-url}/support.html#issues[issue tracker].

[#release-notes-2-25-0-windows-ansi]
=== ANSI Support on Windows

Modern Windows versions (10 and newer) provide native ANSI escape sequence support.
As a result, dependency on the outdated JAnsi 1.x library has been removed.
For details, refer to xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#jansi[ANSI styling on Windows].

[#release-notes-2-25-0-jakarta-jms]
=== Jakarta JMS Appender

A Jakarta-compatible version of the xref:manual/appenders/message-queue.adoc#JmsAppender[JMS Appender] is now included in the core distribution.


[#release-notes-2-25-0-added]
=== Added

* Add Google OSS-Fuzz integration (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2949[2949])
* Add a `GraalVmProcessor` annotation processor to generate GraalVM reachability metadata. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3053[3053])
* Add `MonitorResource` configuration option to support the monitoring of external files in addition to the configuration file itself. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/3074[3074], https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3501[3501])
* Fixed typo in "LoggerConfig.RootLogger.Builder#withtFilter(...)" method. Created new corrected 'withFilter()' method and deprecated old method. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/3369[3369])
* Add `collectionName` and `databaseName` arguments to the MongoDB appender (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3467[3467])

[#release-notes-2-25-0-changed]
=== Changed

* Remove JAnsi library support. Windows 10 console has supported ANSI escapes since 2017. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1736[1736])
* Consolidate exception rendering logic and improve circular reference support in Pattern Layout (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2691[2691], https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3123[3123])
* Rewrite `JAnsiTextRenderer` to work without JAnsi library. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2916[2916])
* Switch prefixing stack traces in Pattern Layout from whitespace to newline (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3045[3045])
* Changes the layout used by the https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html#automatic-configuration[default configuration]. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3118[3118])
* Switch to using Java's `DateTimeFormatter` for date & time formatting of log event instants (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3121[3121], https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2943[2943])
* Switch the default exception converter from xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converter-exception-extended[the extended exception converter] to xref:manual/pattern-layout.adoc#converter-exception[the plain exception converter] (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3123[3123])
* Don't close StringReaders because of batching. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/3127[3127])

* Currently Java 8 users do not have access to timestamps with sub-millisecond precision. This change moves the SystemClock implementation from log4j-core-java9 to log4j-core, overriding the current one, so that java 8 users can benefit from it. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3217[3217])
* Don't overwrite configured configuration name if the configuration has no loggers / no root logger. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/3431[3431])
* Update `GcpLayout.json` JSON Template Layout event template to support automatic timestamp recognition by the Google Cloud Logging. This also changes `exception`, `thread`, `logger` fields, and removes `insertId` field. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3586[3586])
* Have org.apache.logging.log4j.util.Base64Util invoke java.util.Base64 directly instead of reflectively. (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/3686[3686])
* Improve implementations of `LogEvent.toImmutable()` and `ReusableMessage.memento()` and remove usage of `ThrowableProxy`.

[#release-notes-2-25-0-deprecated]
=== Deprecated

* Deprecate `ThrowableProxy` and all its usages (https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/2691[2691], https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/pull/3123[3123])
